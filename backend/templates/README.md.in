This script is available as a package for [Zeek Package Manger](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/index.html)

If ZKG is configured to load packages (see @load packages in quickstart guide), this script will automatically be loaded and ready to go.

```bash
zeek -Cr <path_to_pcap> ${outputFolder}
```

### Package Manager (Local Folder)
